# Movie Recommendation Project

This project is a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. 
Using a combination of data processing and machine learning algorithms, it offers tailored recommendations through methods 
like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

## Features
- **Personalized Movie Recommendations**: Recommends movies based on the user's past preferences and similar user data.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Uses popular recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- **Modular and Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different datasets or new recommendation techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for running and viewing the code interactively)
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahyaanhassan/movie-recommendation-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-project
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```
4. Run each cell in `main.ipynb` to see the recommendation system in action.

## How It Works
The recommendation system analyzes user data and applies recommendation algorithms to suggest movies. It can be customized 
to include different datasets or adjusted to improve accuracy.

## Project Structure
- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data processing, model training, and generating recommendations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate more advanced recommendation algorithms (e.g., hybrid filtering).
- Add support for more data sources (e.g., user ratings, reviews).
- Implement a web interface for easier user interaction.
